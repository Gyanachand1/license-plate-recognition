# License-plate-recognition
This project is aimed to recognise the license plate of the vehicles by the CCTV camera and process the image by dividing
it into number of chunks and recognising it using machine learning from the previously loaded number images and get the
details of the owner from the RTO API and displaying it.

## Flask
Flask micro web framework is used since it is more explicit in nature and easy to get started as a beginner.

### Running the code
Use `git clone` to clone the repository and run the code using `python main.py`. Make sure you have `flask` installed
else use the command `pip3 install flask`.

Open http://localhost:5000 in any browser to get the application in your browser.
